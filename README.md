[nuru](https://github.com/domsson/nuru) is a file format for [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)
 and [ANSI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art). That is, images made 
up of characters. nuru-web allows to easily create and edit nuru files right in 
your browser. It is made with vanilla JavaScript, so there are no dependencies.
