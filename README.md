Currently very early work-in-progress. Check back later or [try the current state](domsson.github.io/nuru-web/).

nuru is a file format for [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)
 and [ANSI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_art). That is, images made 
up of characters. nuru-web allows to easily create and edit nuru files right in 
your browser. It is made with vanilla JavaScript, so there are no dependencies.
